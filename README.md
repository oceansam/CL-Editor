What is CL-Editor?
--
Simple, past cover letter in, change areas where you want dynamic strings and update when necessary for job applications.

How to use?
--

To create a variable in your cover letter simply denote it as [variable_name]. Whatever string is in between the square brackets will take place as the input label. 

An example use case would be
```
Hi, [company_name]

I'm interested in [position_name] because of the inclusive and collaborative environment your team provides!
```

This will create two variable names with labels `company_name` and `position_name`. 
Note. Duplicate occurences of a variable will provide one input but apply to all appearances.

Once you're done, simply click update cover letter and shabam new cover letter.
